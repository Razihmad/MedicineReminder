I have developed a project using the Django web framework that is designed to help hospitals send reminder messages to patients who are taking medication. 
The idea behind this project is to make it easier for hospitals to ensure that their patients are taking their medication as prescribed and to reduce the risk of patients forgetting to take their medication or taking the wrong dose.

To achieve this goal, I integrated the Twilio API into the project to send reminder messages directly to the patients' mobile phones.
This makes it easy for patients to receive and respond to the reminders, ensuring that they never miss a dose.

The project also includes a web interface that hospitals can use to manage patient data and set up reminders. 
The interface is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with features like patient search and data filters to make it easy to find and manage patient information.

Overall, I believe that this project has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of patients by ensuring that they receive the medication they need on time and in the correct dosage. 
It's a powerful tool for hospitals that want to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of medication errors."

This project is under process yet. There are some changes that need to be done .
